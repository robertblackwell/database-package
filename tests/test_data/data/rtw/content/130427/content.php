    <p>There has been no internet along the M56 to Yakutsk so I am some days behind in
    my regular journal posts. So I decided to do a quick update to let friends and family know where we 
    are and what is happening and I will come back and fill in with a more complete
    record over the next few days. We are in Yakutsk, we are safe and sound but we have 
    a significant mechanical issue with the vehicle and for the moment we are unable to travel. 
    Over the next few days we will assess the options available to us for fixing the vehicle
    and do some sightseeing things as well.  </p>
	<?php Skin::JournalGalleryThumbnails($trip, $entry); ?><?php //RenderNamedEntryGallery($trip, $slug, $gal_name); ?><p>Yesterday afternoon at around km marker 1020 our travels came to an abrupt halt. One of the 
    places where the camper or house attaches to the truck frame broke and the camper box
    tilted up at a very worrying angle. Fortunately for us our friend Validimir in Vladivostok
    has a friend Alexander in Yakutsk and he organized for some of his family/friends to come and help us.
    After a brief inspection of the trouble our rescuers quickly sized up the situation and proceeded
    to produce what I would call a "field fix". The repair is certainly only a temporary
    fix but allowed us to continue traveling very slowly towards Yakutsk. After the repair we made only 
    about 30 km before finding a spot beside the road to spend the night and tried to relax after the 
    stress and agitation of the afternoons experience. </p>

    <p>This morning we continued north to the village of Haptagay where we met Alexander and parked the truck
    at the house of his mother-in-law. Here we were treated to a wonderful Yakutia breakfast and an
    opportunity to see inside one of the more traditional Yakutia houses made of squared logs. While
    having a rustic feel the house was cosy and comfortable with all the mod-cons.</p>
    </div>
    <p>After some inspection of the vehicle some plans were made for fixing the vehicle and we headed off
    to the city of Yakutsk (where Alexander lives and were we will stay for the next few days).
    This short trip turned out to be amazing. Why amazing; well to get to Yakutsk we had to cross the Lena
    River which right now is still iced over but the ice is too  weak for road transport. But because
    of the ice, ferries are not yet running. The Russian solution to this problem is a fleet
    of small hovercraft that ferry people and small quantities of cargo across the river.  </p> 
    <p>Anyway that is enough for the moment or this will cease to be a quick update.</p>
