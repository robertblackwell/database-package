			<?php //Skin::JournalGalleryThumbnails($trip, $entry); ?><p>Today was, unsurprisingly, not a very <em>adventurous</em> day and there is not much to write about. 
			This will also be the case off and on over the next few weeks as we visit 
			friends and relatives across Canada - interesting and enjoyable for Nina 
			and I but not something that others will find of particular interest. </p>
			<p>This afternoon while approaching Vancouver along highway 99  we got into a little traffic
			 jam where the road entered a tunnel under the Fraser River. The four lane tunnel (2 lanes in each direction)
			 had been reconfigured for rush hour and only one lane was going into downtown Vancouver.  This merging was happening 
			 at a point where two feeder roads where also merging with Hwy 99- the result, 6 lanes into 1 lane. 
			 We traveled less than 1 miles in 1 hour. However we were saved by the bell, so to speak, as 6:00pm arrived and the
			 road configuration was returned to its normal state and traffic was miraculously moving again.</p>
			 <p>We spent the night <em>gorilla camping</em> in the streets of West vancouver after an enjoyable evening
			 with friends we met on a previous journey through the Central Asian states </p>
