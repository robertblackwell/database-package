    <p>This morning before heading back towards Almaty Nina got up early to walk down the Jeep road to the bottom of Charyn Canyon
    to the informal camping ground at the river. Like a slug I stayed in bed for a while but eventually I felt guilty enough 
    that I got up and followed. The round trip took Nina 1 and 1/2 hours and I only caught up to her 100m from the truck.
    Either Nina is getting faster, or I am getting slower. It was a pleasant walk as the valley through which the track passes 
    was in shade for most of the time. We also discovered why the rangers warned us not to drive this track; at one point the track
    passes under a couple of big  bolders and has no more the 7-8 feet of clearance.</p>

    <p>After our walk we started the drive back to Almaty, again enjoying the small village markets and the large shade giving trees that
    line much of the highway. In places the trees arch over the road from both sides almost forming a green tunnel. They certainly provide
    a nice shady place to stop and get some relief from the sun. That was important because today was hot; our first day over 100&deg;F.</p>
    <p>The problem with the truck whereby it spontaniously changes into neutral re-appeared today with a couple
    of incidents late in the drive; but not enough to make driving difficult or dangerous.</p>
