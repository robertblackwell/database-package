			<?php //Skin::JournalGalleryThumbnails($trip, $entry); ?><p>We had much of the today to ourselves before a dinner date late in the afternoon. 
		The Lonely Planet guide came to our rescue and we headed off early to Lake Buntzen, a reservoir 
		created by the BC Hydro company. </p>
		<p>Both the guide book and locals warned us that this would be a popular (that is crowded) place on such a sunny
		Saturday. We seemed to be ahead of the rush and found a parking place with no trouble and settled in for an extended stay.</p>
		<p>It was a very pleasant place, beautiful lake, lovely mountain setting, and the predicted crowds did eventually arrive.</p>
		<p>Nina chose to busy herself walking the 12km "around the lake" trail.</p>
		<p>I chose to sit on the beach doing a bit of people watching. On the beach the cosmopolitan nature 
		(that is broad ethnic mix) of Vancouver's population was evident.  </p>
		<p>Later in the day finding our way to Langley and our dinner date presented us with opportunities to practice 
		city driving skills. </p>
		<p>Another night of <em>gorilla camping</em> in the streets of Langley.</p>
