			<p>We re-entered the US via highway 59 (into Minnesota) just south of the town of Tolstoi. This crossing does not seem to get a lot of
			traffic as all US customs lanes were closed when we pulled up. Initially we were questioned in a gruff manner by the guards
			but after they worked out that we were residents and the vehicle a motorhome things improved. They of course wanted a 
			look inside the vehicle and admitted it was just out of curiosity.</p>
			<?php //Skin::JournalGalleryThumbnails($trip, $entry); ?><p>A short drive to the west took us to I-29 and North Dakota our route for the next couple of days. </p>
			<p>Our first priority was to get some fuel as we had traveled over 1200 miles since our last fill in Calgary
			(with a small addition in Steinbach - just enough to get us to the US and lower prices).</p>
