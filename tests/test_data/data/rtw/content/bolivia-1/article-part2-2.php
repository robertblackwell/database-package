	<h2>another day</h2>

		<p>We were pleased to see the sun pop over the horizon and start the process of thawing out us and the Tiger (our camper). 
		It was a cold night, the Tigers plumbing was frozen, the dish cloth on the sink was frozen, and over breakfast 
		we were in our down jackets with the heater on. The trucks thermometer 
		showed 2&deg;F as we started the engine ready to get underway. 
		I guess the minimum was a good deal lower than that.</p>

		<p>We headed west along the southern shore of the lake then north along the western shore. At the north western 
		corner of the lake we passed through a small settlement or outpost of some kind. 
		There was a boom gate that was open and nobody tried to stop us.</p>

		<p>North of the lake the trail crossed a modest mountain ridge linking <em>Carcanis</em> on the west with <em>Juntacha</em>
		on the east before dropping down into the southern end of desierto Siloli. The road over this range was very rough and
		gave us a sample of what lay ahead. </p>
		<p>At the southern end of desierto Siloli was a famous rock formation called <em>arbol de piedre</em>. I had taken
		GPS co-ordinates for this tourist attraction from Google Earth and it was something we had intended to see. But at the time
		we concluded that we could not find it. It was only later when looking through our photos that we discovered that we
		had in fact driven right past it, and even photographed it.</p>
		<p>We drove north through desierto de Siloli for what felt like miles following the general flow of vehicle tracks. 
		At times there was a definite main track but for much of the way there were just old tire marks in the sand and gravel, that all 
		generally headed in the same direction.
		The scenery was stunning. The valley floor over which the track passed was mainly sand and gravel or various hues of brown.
		The mountains that surround those valleys were multi-colored under the influence of minerals and evident thermal activity.
		There was no green vegetation anywhere.</p>

	<h2>follow the landcruisers</h2>

		<p>The northern end of desierto de Siloli was dominated by Volcan Ascotan (5473) and for much of the drive through Siloli
		we seemed to be heading directly towards it and the smaller mountains in front of it. As we neared the northern end of
		Siloli it became obvious that a decision was going to be needed as we could see vehicle tracks veering away from
		the mountains to both the right (east) and to the left (west). Closer still we could make out the buildings of the
		famous Hotel de Desierto sitting up against the southern flank of the Ascotan massif.</p>
		<p>We were pretty sure we needed to go east around the mountains but unfortunately I had not followed the trail this far
		north during my Google Earth research so had no GPS waypoints. Our decision was finalized by a passing landcruiser
		carrying a group of backpackers - we followed them east. That epiphany turned into a rule that we used a number of times
		during the remainder of the day: <em>when in doubt .. follow the Landcruisers</em></p>

		<p>After our decision we followed the tracks north for many miles on the south eastern flanks of Ascotan. The trail was rough,
		progress was slow but steady and we
		had the good sense to avoid a few branching trails that turned east.</p>
		<p>At a point due east of the summit of Ascotan we once again had to apply the principle of <em>follow the landcruisers</em>.</p>
		<p>We were at the south end of what looked like a dry lake bed and the trail was very indistinct, with some vehicle tracks
		heading west around the edge of the lake bed and others straight across. To be honest I was nervous. I was concerned that
		the lake bed might be soft, and to add to this we were well past the half way point in our fuel. We did not have enough
		fuel to get seriously lost or stuck.</p>
		<p>We stopped and made lunch. As we were cleaning up a group of landcruisers barreled by. We could not keep up with them but we 
		followed their fresh tracks and dust across that lake bed, through a narrow valley on the other side and emerged on the shores
		of Laguna Honda. We parked there beside a group of tour vehicles, backpackers and a decent sized flock of flamingoes. </p>

	<h2>On highway 701</h2>

		<p>We did not know it at the time but our journey through the high desert on vague vehicle tracks was nearly over.
		We were only 10 kms from what the Bolivians term a main road, highway 701 which would eventually take us all the way to Uyuni.
		But the desert had not finished with us yet as those 10 km were <em>unbelievably rough</em>. Our vehicle
		bounced so much that at times it was difficult to hold onto the steering wheel, we were in 1st gear for much of that 10 km. 
		Mind you this did not seem to slow down those landcruisers they simply raced passed us.</p>
		<p>On the way to 701 we passed by Lagunas Chia Kkota, Canapa and Hedionda. We spent little time admiring these
		wonderful sites as concern about fuel was beginning to dominate my thoughts.</p>
		<p>Once at 701 we were confused. According to our map there was NOT supposed to be a highway here. It was supposed
		to be many miles away near the railway line. I decided we would drive west along 701 to Ollague (the border town)
		in the hope of getting fuel and directions. This turned out to be a waste of time. At Ollague we were told that the 
		way to Uyuni was back east along 701 the way we had come and the closest fuel was at San Christobel some 130km away. 
		</p>

	<h2>Uyuni</h2>

		<p>Road 701 to San Christobel was an OK earth road, sometimes smooth sometimes rough. In San Christobel we camped in the
		parking lot of the only hotel and connected to electricity in their reception area. But got no fuel - the only station had no diesel.</p>
		<p>From San Christobel to Uyuni the road was rough, in places very rough. Believe it or not we saw many local vehicles
		that simply decided not to drive on the road but instead drove through the scrub beside of the road. Even gravel trucks and 	buses did this.</p>
		<p>In Uyuni we stayed at hotel Tonito, operated by an America/Bolivian couple. 
		They had room for 1-2 vehicles to park inside their compound. Chris (the American) 
		also runs a pizza restaurant (Minuteman Pizza) in the hotel.
		That was a welcome change of diet. </p>
		<p>From Uyuni,as a day trip, we drove to salar de Uyuni and 50 miles into the middle of the salar 
		to Isla Inca Huasi.</p>
		<p>If you are anywhere near Uyuni this is a drive not to be missed. The experience of driving on the salar, no roads, simply
		navigate by GPS is <em>amazing</em>. Mind you for everything there is a price. In this case the 20 kms
		from Uyuni to the village of Colchani where one enters the salar. 
		This is without a doubt the worst road I have ever driven. </p>
		<p>We got  fuel finally in Uyuni, but not without trouble. Only one of the towns 3 gas stations would sell to us. Chris
		told us that the other two were saving the fuel for those Landcruisers and other locals.</p>

<h2>final comments</h2>

	<p>The days we spent driving from San Pedro, and on salar de Uyuni to Inca Huasi are among the 
	best (we enjoyed the most) 3-4 days of our
	19 month journey. We would like to make sure other travelers get the opportunity, or at least know about the possibility.
	Driving your own vehicle is much better than taking one of those Landcruiser tours.</p>
	<p>Final note. We traveled from San Pedro way too fast. If we did it again we would try and take 7-8 days.</p>
