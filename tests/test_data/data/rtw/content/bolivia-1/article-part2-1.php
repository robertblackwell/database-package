	<h2>..to the Bolivian border ....</h2>

		<p>The morning of May 28th found us headed west on Chilean highway 27 out of San Pedro fueled up and armed 
		with navigation aids that consisted of a pamphlet
		for one of those Landcruiser tours, 
		some GPS waypoints that I had plucked from Google Earth, and a general (and very poor quality) map of Bolivia.</p>
		<p>Even the first 30+ miles on the relatively tame black-top of highway 27 was spectacular.</p> 
		<p>Standing just north of the road and dominating the
		view ahead was <em>Licancabur</em> (a beautiful volcanic cone) at 5920m. </p>
		<p>The road itself is also more than a mite impressive. 
		Starting in San Pedro at 8000 ft it climbed to over 15,000 ft
		as it passed Licancabur and the turnoff to Bolivia. However unlike most mountain roads that 
		climb 7000 ft in a short distance this stretch of
		road is not a series of switchbacks but is basically straight. Can you imagine a 30 mile 
		stretch of straight road that climbs over 7000ft!!</p>
		<p>It must be hell for the truckies. Along the road we counted over a dozen of those emergency stopping lanes that trucks use when their 
		brakes fail.</p>
		
		<p>As highway 27 passed Licancabur we were keeping a sharp eye open for the turn north to Bolivia. There was no signpost, simply a myriad
		of two wheel tracks where vehicles had picked their own spot to start north. 
		I knew from my previous Google Earth research and the GPS
		waypoints that we were in the right place so we picked a track and followed it. About three miles on we approached a 
		boom gate across the gravel track with a single hut standing beside it. We knew this was the right 
		place because the building was surrounded by
		Landcruisers and a horde of young backpackers wrapped in blankets trying to stay warm. The air temperature was just below
		freezing and the wind was at least 20mph.</p>
		
	<h2>Immigration, customs and the Avaroa Fauna Reserve</h2>
	
		<p>Border formalities were straight forward. They process a lot of tourists here so know what to do.</p>
		<p>However the immigration officer said something to me along the
		lines of <em>necesita ....aduanas ..... ochenta kilometers .... del camino.... </em>.</p>
		<p> At the time the officers comment barely registered, but some miles later I started thinking about this and realized that
		he had told us we needed to go to the customs station (for import processing of the vehicle), that the customs station was some distance (a long distance - did he really say 80kms)
		down the road and was a significant detour to get to it.</p>
		<p>A few more miles and we passed through another boom gate, the entry point to the Avaroa Reserve. I think the entry fee was $10.</p>
		<p>For a while all the formalities were done and we could move on, and enjoy the roads and the scenery.</p>

	<h2>Laguna Verde</h2>

		<p>A spectacular turquoise lake, edged with a white salt crust mixed with ice and surrounded with the brown treeless, grassless
		surface of the antiplano. From the northern side Licancabur made a spectacular backdrop.</p>
		<p>There were vehicle tracks everywhere around the lake but to the north they converge to pass between two small mountains. 
		Beyond this small pass we were in the <em>Valle de Dali</em>. A surrealistic landscape of sand adorned with
		a scattering of wind craved rocks. Through this valley the trail traveled
		approximately north. The way was obvious even though there was a choice of which actual track to follow.</p>
		<p>At the northern end of the valley we arrived at <em>Termes de Polques</em>. There were a number of Landcruisers parked,
		the drivers were hanging about talking and smoking, while their guests lounged in the warm waters of the Termes.
		We joined the young tourists in the water. It was warm enough to get in, but getting out into the cold air was a bit of a trial.</p>
	
	<h2>Customs</h2>

		<p>Not long after leaving the Termes the trail gradually swung left/west, passed an area 
		of geysers and thermal activity called <em>pleine luna de Sol de Manana</em> before arriving at a junction.</p>
		<p>The junction was a little hard to distinguish as it was dispersed over a wide area. One branch went north towards
		Laguna Colorado and was the way our journey would continue after our visit to the customs station. The other branch
		continued west and after 5km or so arrived at a small knot of buildings and a very basic football (soccer) field. We were
		a bit surprised by the soccer field. Our GPS was registering 5000m - thats 16,500ft. Who plays soccer at that altitude?</p>
		<p>The place felt like we were on the moon, so desolate. Interestingly there seemed to be a small geothermal power station 
		providing electricity for the establishment.
		Walking over to the buildings and knocking on a door was an effort - this was too high for us even with our acclimatization.</p>
		<p>Eventually someone responds to our knocking and a man opened the door; he was still buttoning up his clothes. 
		We guessed we woke him up.
		His office was tidy, with a lot of late model computer and communications equipment. 
		He processed the paper work efficiently and we were on our way in under 30 minutes. Just amazing.</p>
		<p>Only later did we realize that this customs office was over 45 miles from the immigration office.</p>
		<p>Back at the junction we turned up the northern trail only to discover a big signpost stretching over the road. 
		The writing was almost gone 
		but it seemed to be telling us that we should go to the <em>aduana</em>. Glad we had done that.</p>
		<p>We stopped for the night on the south eastern corner of Laguna Colorado, altitude 14,000 ft.</p>
		<p>We spent some time photographing the local Vicunas and birds as well as the lake in the beautiful afternoon light.
		As evening turned into night the temperature dropped markedly and we were treated to a wonderful display of bright stars.
		Unfortunately the nights temperature was not conducive to a lengthy period of star gazing.</p>
