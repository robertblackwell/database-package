			<h2>..the Bolivia dry season ..</h2>
				<p>It is worth noting that we were there in late May early in the Bolivian dry season, 
				which runs from April to October. 
				Unfortunately we were also there at  
				the beginning of winter and at 4000+m it can, and did, get cold.
				During the warmer wet season the Salar de Uyuni is often covered with water,
				the roads difficult and the skies cloudy. </p>

			<h2>..aduana and Chilean jeepers</h2>
                <p>At the end of our stay in Uyuni we meet a group of Chileans from the <em>Coyhaique 4x4 club</em>
                on holiday in their short wheel base Toyotas. They had missed that turn off to Bolivia custom,
                and 
                were a little concerned as to what problems they would encounter trying to leave the country.</p>
                <p>Interestingly we had met some of these guys when we caught the ferry across Fiordo Mitchell
                during our drive down the Carratera Austral in southern Chile. That was 4+ months ago, nearly 12,000
                road miles for us and 2000 miles as the crow flies for them.</p>
                <p>What a small world.</p>

			<h2>fuel</h2>
	                <p>As we left Laguna Colorado we were beginning to think about fuel.</p>
	                <p>We had not yet used half our fuel, but since we had no idea how far we had to 
	                go and where we could refuel this was a concern that would grow throughout the day.</p>
	                <p>By the time we got to highway 701 we were more than a little concerned. After getting
	                no fuel in San Christobel we started counting miles.</p>
	                <p>For reference between San pedro and Uyuni we traveled 280 miles and got some of the worst
	                mileage of our trip. If you do this leg carry plenty of fuel.</p>

            <h2>..the route west ..</h2>
                <p>Subsequent study of Google Earth suggests that the route to the west of the Hotel Desierto 
                would also be feasible, at least as a side
                trip, and would provide access to Salar de Ascotan and Salar de Caracote. Continuing that way seems like
                it would take one back into Chile and the border town of Ollaque.</p>
