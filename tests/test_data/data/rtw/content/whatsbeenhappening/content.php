		<p>So whats going on with us?. A gap of over a month in new posts and then some posts on obscure
		technical stuff about Garmin GPS maps and fuel tanks.</p>
		<p>Well; we arrived back in Washington at the start of February with a long list of things to
		do in preparation for shipping the truck and ourselves to Russia for the start of the Eurasian leg
		of our journey.</p>
		<p>As I write the truck is onboard the RORO vessel the <em>Grand Pace</em> on its way across
		the Pacific. It departed March 20th from Everett, WA and is scheduled to arrive in Vladivostok
		on April 5th. We fly out April 2nd via Beijing to Vladivostok arriving on April 4th. 
		We hope to be traveling by mid April.</p>
		<p>It has been a busy period with a long list of things to do on the truck before it was presented to the
		port for shipping. With that out of the way then we had a lot of personal business to
		cover (doing US taxes not the least).</p>
		<p>Finally I wanted to get a new edition of this website published before we headed to Russia.</p>
		<p>You will notice some minor changes on the front (home) pages and there are a lot of behind the
		scene changes you will probably not notice.</p>
		<p>The big content change (addition) is a new format
		and a lot of new material under the <em>Vehicle</em> heading; this stuff
		is definitely for <em>truck nerds</em> and I hope others will
		forgive my obsession around the various topics.</p>
		<p>I have also made a start on some material under the heading of <em>How</em>, specifically 
		the topics of visas and shipping which I will try and complete before those topics are too far
		behind us.</p>
