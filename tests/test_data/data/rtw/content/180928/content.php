    <p>Todays goal was to try for some good photos of Mount Rainier, we were optomistic as 
    the weather was great so we decided that Sunrie Visitor Center would be the best 
	spot as we would not be in position until afternoon. That proved to be a less than 
	ideal choice as by the time we got there the sun was over the top of the mountain 
	making for poor light. Still the drive along Hwy 410 and along the Sunrise entrance road 
	was enjoyable.</p>

    <p>After our visit with Rainier we headed up through Chnook Pass and east along Hwy 12
    looking for a place to camp.</p>
    <div id='camping'>
    	<p>We camped at a horse camp called <em>Crow Lake Way Trailhead</em> along Highway 12. A 
    	lot of fallen trees, clean pit toilets but not much else.</p>
