	<p>Today was one of those perfect lessons in the importance of keeping your electronic devices (and their software) up to date.</p>
	<p>After a leisurely breakfast we set off to Maple Ridge to catch up with some more family members. 
	However we ran into a little problem.
	In order to cross the Fraser river from Langley to Maple Ridge our trusty Garmin insisted on taking us to the ferry at 
	McMillan Island, where-as we had been told to take the new and 
	spectacular <em>Golden Ears</em> bridge. It of course soon dawned on us that the problem was out of date software, 
	our Garmin did not know about the bridge, nor for that matter that the ferry was no longer operational. 
	After some frustration and guesswork navigation we got ourselves sorted out, arrived at our destination and spent 
	a pleasant hot summers afternoon catching up with developments in the Vancouver branch of the family.</p>
