			<?php Skin::JournalGalleryThumbnails($trip, $entry); ?><p>Today the prairies started for real. Oceans of green and yellow (canola crops), rolling country side and
			roads that go straight for miles at a time. The mix of green (wheat and other crops) and the yellow canola
			fields was the visual highlight of the day.</p>
			<p>The low light of the day was undoubtedly our stop for fuel at  Flying-J. We got into a round of pump and 
			computer problems. At one point their computers were asserting that we had completely filled our tanks
			when we had not actually even started. It is worth noting that we saw this as somewhat of a big deal as 
			we expected the fill to cost somewhere between $400-$600. </p>
			<p>For much of the day we toured the country around Drumheller, North East of Calgary. It is famous for
			its <em>bad lands</em>. Landscapes of multi-colored eroded formations called <em>hoo doos</em>.</p>
			<p>Late in the day we tried our hand at a short section of rough vehicle trail. This was our first
			experience "off road" with the yellow beast. I am pleased to say we did not break anything.  </p>
