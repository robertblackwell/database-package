		<p>We spent the morning traveling east along a mix of gravel and rough black-top backroads
		through picturesque farming and grass lands. Late in the morning we took a detour to Grasslands National
		Park an area set aside to be restored to pre-farming conditions with natural grass and indigenous animals.
		</p>
		<p>At an overlook called <em>70 mile mesa</em> we took a short hiking trail and then followed a self guided 
		driving trail through French River valley. Along the drive we found an extensive prairie dog colony
		and spent some time trying to catch the guards standing on their posts.</p>
		<p>The afternoon was devoted to covering some miles so that we are within striking distance of Winnipeg for
		our Wednesday appointment.</p>
