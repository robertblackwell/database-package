	<p>We stopped for a long while in Lewiston this morning. The town has a nice skate park and walking trail beside the river. We took advantage of this facility, and the fine sunny weather, to undertake our daily exercises. I am on a regime of strengthening and stretching from my physical therapist and Nina is aiming to achieve her Apple Watch goal of 10,000 steps every day.

	<p>After Lewiston we traveled for the remainder of the day beside the Clearwater River and spend a pleasant few
	hours at an attractive Rest Area.</p>

		<p>Our camping place for the night was a <em>River Access</em> parking lot beside the Clearwater
		at a spot labeled "Five Mile Creek". Idaho seems to have made considerable effort to provide
		for its fishing enthusiasts as these "river access" areas were very common and generally well maintained.</p>
