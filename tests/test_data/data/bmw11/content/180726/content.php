    <p>The first town on my route out of Castlegar this morning was Trail, BC. It was clearly an old mining town
	    built in and on the sides of a steep valley with small or narrow houses. Fortunately for the
	    town some mining and or metallurgical facilities still operates; though also clearly tourism
	    is now a substantial income source for the area. I was intrigued by the sign at the exit to the town
	    I did not know Italian was one of the Canadian languages.

    <p>The day turned out to be hot, really hot at times (102&deg; F in Omak WA), and an accompanying heat haze
	    took photography off the agenda for much of the day. However I made a small effort (leave it at that).  </p>
    <div id='camping'>
	    <p>I was pleased to arrive at Winthrop and find a shaded tent site at the KOA Campground just east of the town.
		 Though I must admit to a bit of short term sticker shock at the price, over $40 to pitch a 2 man tent. More than twice
		 what I have paid elsewhere.
	    </p>
	    <p>Still it was nice to stop and remove the hot riding cloths.</p>
