    <p>We were pleasantly surprised this morning to find that the campground had a cafe that opened at 8:00 so morning coffee was
	    pretty easy to organize. So once fortified we packed and headed to the ferry terminal to await the loading of the vessel
	    to Horse Shoe Bay. By the time loading started there were a large pack of bikes of all kinds most laden down with gear
	    for an extended journey.
    </p>
    <p>The road from the ferry terminal to Whistler is called the <em>Sea to Sky Highway</em> and it was pretty busy
	    with lots of motorcyclists out enjoying the warmer weather, the nice twisty road and great road surface. After Whistler
	    the road continued to be enjoyable and the traffic reduced substantially.
    </p>
    <p>All in all a great days riding.</p>

	    <p>We got into Lillooet about 6:00 found a room in the <em>Hotel De Oro</em>, almost nothing else open in the town
		    so dinner was beer and potato chips.
