		<p>It was cloudy this morning as we left our camp beside the dam. However within an hour
			the sun had burned off the cloud and we had a fine day for our trip down the western slopes of the Rockies
			into the Denver area. Tomorrow we drop the ER at the Earthroamer factory for some repairs at their favourite
			Ford dealer.</p>
			<?php Skin::JournalGalleryThumbnails($trip, $entry); ?>
			<p>The first part of the day was spent climbing through Aspen on our way to 12,000+ft Independence pass.
			This was the first big climb we had done in the ER and I was happy with the way it performed. We found winter
			still lingering in the pass with lots of snow remaining and temperatures well down in the 30's.</p>
			<p>Decending Independence Pass we eventually rolled into Leadville picked up some fuel and then climbed
			up SR91 to the Clinton Gulth Resrevoir. 
			There is a lot of earth work taking place there but we could not really figure out what was being built. </p>
			<p>Eventually we joioned up with I-70 and rolled into the old mining district of <em>Silver Plume</em>
			and <em>George Town</em>. I could tell by Nina's excitement at seeing the old steam railway that we will be 
			back to this place sometime in the next few years.</p>
			<p>Hooking up with SR6 we followed a steady line of traffic along the canyon of Clear Creek until Sr119.
			there after we wandered around for sometime trying to find a place to spend the night.
			Eventually we were at I-25 only a few miles from Earthroamer HQ checking into Saint Vrain State Park.</p>
			<p>Late in the afternoon another ER came into the park and we spent some time with the owners chatting 
			about things ER.</p>
			<p>We will pick up this journal in July when we return to collect our ER.</p>
