    <p>Nina and I are about start what I think of as a <em>mini adventure</em>. Between now and November we plan on doing some
	    traveling in our Earthroamer. As is often the case for us the route is not well specified but will probably include a lot
	    of time in the Western US and Western Canada. The goal of this exercise is entertainment and relaxation while my
	    leg recovers enough to allow us to get back into the Unimog with its manual transmission and heavy clutch. 
    </p>
    <p>How could 3 to 4 months on the road be a &quot; mini &quot; adventure - everything is relative i guess.</p>
    <p>In amongst all this &quot; entertainment and relaxation&quot; we will have to do a few chores including another drive to/from
	    Phoenix to collect my pickup truck. </p>

    <p>As you can see from the photos above I had to do a bit of re-training on some of the more challenging features of our Earthroamer
	    (here after called <em>the ER</em>). 
    </p>
    <p>It was also nice to say hello to some of the current residents of our house. </p>

	    <h3>Camping</h3>
	    <p>After a late start today and fighting our way through Seattle to Hwy 20 (also called the North Cascade Highway) we happened
		    upon a delightful state park called <em>Rasar</em> set amidst a mix of old growth forest and farmland. The place was 
		    cute and peaceful, with some simply magnificent trees and a nice network of short hiking trails. 
		    It was a nice re-introduction for us to the forests of the Pacific NW.

	    <p>It was not cheap though at <em class="price">$30 per night for a non-serviced site</em>
