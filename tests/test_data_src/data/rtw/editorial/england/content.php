        <h2 style="text-align:left">Hello from the United Kingdom</h2>
		<p>We are now in England, having caught a ferry from the Hook of Holland on August 19.
		Initially spent a week on a canal boat with some of the family, and after that
		we are not quite sure how long we will be on the these isles; that will depend on how difficult
		I find it driving our yellow monster on UK roads.	
		</p>
		<p>
			Our plan is to spend a few days in London (without the truck), attend a get-together of
			"overlander types" near the town of Worcester over the weekend of September 5th.
		</p>
		<p>
			Take a short trip to Scotland, return the truck to Amsterdam and then have 3 weeks
			in Ireland without the truck.
