        <h2 style="text-align:left">Across the USA 2018</h2>
		<p>Our next mini adventure is entirely within the USA and will include a stop at 
			Overland Expo East 2018 which will be in Asheville, North Carolina in early November.
		</p>
		<p>We realized some time ago that while we have undertaken many short adventures within the 
			US, and crossed the continent a number of times, we have never pulled those various
			journeys together into one of the Photography Books that Nina has made of all of our other
			travels.
			Thus we decided that this years Overland Expo East would provide us with a good opportunity 
			to round out our collection of US photos in preparation for that "US" photo book.
		</p>
		<p>In addition the trip provides an opportunity to call in on Rob Pickering in La Junta, CO 
		for some over due maintenance on our Unimog.</p>
		<p>All in all we expect to be on the road for about three months, returning to WA in late
		December, after Christmas. This timing will leave us 6-8 weeks to do final preparation for our 2019 
		adventure. More on that topic later.</p>
