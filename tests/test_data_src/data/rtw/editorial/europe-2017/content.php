        <h2 style="text-align:left">Back in Europe</h2>
	    <p>After a a much longer delay than we ever expected we are back in Europe to 
		undertake one last European episode in the Yellow beast. We will undoubtedly be back in Europe again
		after this but not with the Yellow GXV as at the end of this episode we will ship the vehicle
		back to North America.</p>
		<p>The broad plan for this visit is to spend some time in Spain and Portugal. We will start that
			exploration by driving to Badenweiler in southern Germany to visit our eldest son and
			then towards Figueres and Barcelona (in North Eastern Spain) 
			and thence a counter clockwise circumnavigation of Spain
			and Portugal.
