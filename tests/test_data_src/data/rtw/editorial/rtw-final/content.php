	<h2>Around the World</h2>
	<p>This is the home page for our longest overlanding adventure occupying approximately 5 years and taking us around the world from the far East of Canada, across North America, the Pacific Ocean to Eastern Russia, then through the Asian continent to explore Europe and then finally 
	across the Atlantic back to Eastern Canada.</p>
	<p>For this adventure we acquired a different vehicle, a 2003 Unimog U500 with a custom camper box built by Global Expedition Vehicles.</p>
	<p>As you will see from the detailed record that adventure occupied the second half of 2012, all of 2013 and big chunks of 2014, 2015, and 2017. Unfortunately I was carrying an injury during 2016 so the Unimg sat unused in storage in Europe that year.</p>
	<p>Again you can see the full record of this journey and lots of info about the vehicle and logistics this adventure 
	by following the menu items at the top of the page.
