	    <p>Our slow tour of the western USA and Canada is over and with it our first longish trip in our Earthroamer.
		    We found the ER not quite as comfortable as our Yellow Mog but none-the-less enjoyable. The trip was also a success from
		    the sight-seeing point of view with lots of great scenery and of course those polar bears.
	    </p>
	    <p>We are taking a break from vehicle based travel and hence will be off the air as far as this blog goes until some time in the new year.</p>
