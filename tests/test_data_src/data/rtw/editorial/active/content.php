        <h2>Back in Europe</h2>
		<p>In mid June 2015 we flew back to Europe after a long break from traveling in the truck.
			To see what we got up to during the break read the post for 
			<a href="/posts/rtw/150618">18th June 2015</a>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Our return to Europe marks the start of another chapter in our travels. 
			Initially we will spend a month in Iceland and then some as yet unspecified time in Europe, UK 
			and probably Morocco. But as always the details will unfold as we go. Changing our mind is one
			of the real virtues of traveling in a motorhome.
		</p>
		<p>
			During our absense the truck was cared for by the guys at <a href="http://www.merex-unimog.com">Merex</a>,
			as always they did a great job and after a few days driving everything seems in good order. So thanks
			to Rene, Niel, Elke and Eugen.
